Combination of Unreal Engine and TouchDesigner with VR Tracking, Camera-based body tracking, and midi/osc input to drive an interactive projection + LED installation and accompanying live performance.

This project & performance is our first project using Unreal Engine 5. It is an exploration of how to work with this new tool while also streamlining and improving our system overall.

Currently this project is being designed to run on a single, powerful desktop, but we are also trying to figure out how it could make sense to distribute tasks between two or more machines, or how to effectively utilize multiple gpus.

Figure 2, where the signal data is actually processed and utilized by visual software is still being iterated on and updated as we figure out best to organize and optimize the system. Ideally, the system architecture we are creating with project will create a reusable ground work that we can continue to build on for future projects, as well as share with other artists and developers.
